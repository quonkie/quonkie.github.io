<h1> Responsive Story Creative Brief</h1>

<p>
	My idea for this Responsive Story is based off of the movie, Big Hero 6. In this movie, there is a particular scene where Tadashi is working on building Baymax for countless hours over days, weeks, and even a few months. There is a montage of small clips that show his frustration and exasperation as he is trying to work on different tasks to make sure Baymax work. At the end, when Tadashi is about to give up, Baymax comes to life and Tadashi is overjoyed. I am either going to use this clip, or I am going to make my own video with that scene in mind. I will probably show myself working on something for this Web class as I go through ups and downs and finally am successful working on the project.
