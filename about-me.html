<p> Hi there, my name is Stephanie. I’m from Orange County, Southern California and have lived in Boulder, Colorado for 5 years. I’m a double major in Psychology and Communication with a certificate in TAM. I love breakfast, Bhakti Chai, coffee, dark chocolate, red wine, sunflowers, and swing dancing. My long term life goal is to travel everywhere I possibly can. The top place on my bucket list to visit is Australia because I want swim the Great Barrier Reef before it goes away forever. I don’t know what I want to do after I graduate. Honestly, the thought gives me anxiety But I’m open to suggestions. Or job offerings. </p>
