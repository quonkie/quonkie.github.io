<h1> Man, I hope I have enough money to get home.</h1>
<p> I find my wallet in my jacket pocket that was hanging up near the door and check to see how much I have. $10, not bad. I pull out my phone and figure out which is the best way to get home: <a href= "transit.html"> take the bus </a> , <a href= "lyft.html"> request a Lyft </a> , <a href= "callafriend.html"> or call a friend and see if anyone from last night is still around to give me a ride home. </a>
