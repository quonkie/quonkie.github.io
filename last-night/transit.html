<p> I look up how to take the AB Bus back to Boulder Transit Center, and walk to the bus stop. I am lucky that I found my bus pass in my wallet so it doesn't cost me anything. As I head on my way home, I answer back to my text messages and check up on my social media platforms to see what else I missed. A night out in Denver was great, but I am so glad to be heading home. </p
