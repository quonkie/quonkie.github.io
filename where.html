	<p> I wake up, on my stomach, face smushed into a throw pillow, on a black leather couch. I pick my head up, wipe off the bit of drool on the side of my mouth and sit up. My head is spinning and I am disoriented. I don't recognize this place. I don't even know how I ended up here. The sun light hurts my eyes and I look to find a <a href= "time.html"> clock. </a> 
	Out of the corner of my eye, I see a <a href= "note.html"> note </a> sitting on the end table next to the couch. Somehow my phone is sitting on the table too. Really glad I didn't lose that. 
	I pick up my phone and check to see if I have any <a href= "text-messages.html"> text messages </a> or <a href= "instagram.html"> notifications. </a> Maybe that will help me figure out how I even got here.  </p>
