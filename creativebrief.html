<p> It's 6am on a Saturday morning, and you have no idea where you are. Or how you got there. You find yourself in a hotel room and have no other belongings besides the clothes on your back, your cell phone, and your wallet with a couple of spare bills for cash. How will you get yourself home? Will you be able to retrace your steps from the night before? Let's find out... </p>
<h2> Creative interpretation and theme</h2>
<p> One of the biggest influences technology has on our lives today is helping people navigate their way through the world. In a more literal sense, many people use their smartphones and technology when they are lost and don't know where they need to go. If GPS, or an app on a phone like Google Maps is not readily available due to a loss of cell service, then it can cause many problems for people. In this narrative, I want to take the user through a story that will be relatable, interesting, and fun. By looking through pictures, text messages, google maps, Uber (or Lyft) as well as documentation from social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, the user will slowly recall events from the night before.  Information from the night will slowly be pieced back together as the user remembers the events that took place. In addition, they will also be trying to figure out how to get home and determining what technology will be best to find transportation. The clear objective and goal to end the narrative will be for the user to reach their final destination and to successfully navigate themselves through uncharted territory. But, this narrative will also make the user acknowledge how useful multiple platforms can be while also understand how it is nearly impossible to escape the use of technology in the modern age. </p>

<h2>Technical execution and design</h2>

<p> The execution of this narrative will start in a location unfamiliar to the main character in the narrative. The initial idea would be to wake up in a hotel room somewhere in a city like Denver and not know how you got there. From the hotel room you would have to navigate your journey through multiple sets of options in order to understand what happened last night and how to get home (Uber, Lyft, RTD, Taxi, Private Helicopter). Both paths (understanding last night’s story and how to get home) would be by utilizing technology through screens that could mimic social media posts and videos which would allow the user to interact with the story. Links would take the user through different posts, pictures, messages which would all be interconnected in various ways and show the story unfolding. The story may not be the same for each user depending what they click on first. The story could be shown as linear or could be jumbled up and out of order depending on what is shown, viewed, or read. But overall, it will be an interesting adventure. </p>

<h2> Inspirations and examples of work that are influencing your project </h2>

	<p> The main inspirations for this narrative come from two novels, Paper Towns by John Green and Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. Both stories feature a character who is following clues to understand a person who is missing or lost. Through hidden clues and reliving past memories, the main characters are able to piece together what has happening and sift through the confusion to find clarity. I like the clever way both stories take the reader through a nonlinear path to reach the final destination. In addition to these two books of captivating adventure, I also want to make the narrative fun. So, I am also taking inspiration from the movie, The Hangover. Now this narrative won’t be as nearly as crazy as that movie. But, I appreciate the real life relatable scenario of having a crazy fun night, and waking up the next morning disoriented and confused not knowing where you are or how you got there. In this context, technology can be perfectly intertwined with the story; if this scenario actually happened then the person would be texting people or looking back through social media platforms to try and remember what in the world happened. It may be a bit silly, but I think it will be a fun project to work on. </p>
