	<h1> Sometimes, coffee is just <i> needed </i> </h1>

	<p> I find the last bit of coffee in a french press sitting on the kitchen counter. I search through the cabinets until I find where the mugs are and help myself to a cup. I turn around, lean against the counter, and sip my coffee. The apartment looks more refined than a typical college kid place, but I don't remember ever visiting this place before. I see on the fridge that there are some pictures hung up by magnets. I see one in particular of my friend Janet; it's a selfie I saw on her <a href= "instagram.html"> Instagram </a> a few weeks ago. She is smiling while standing next to some guy. Is this Nick? I walk over to grab my phone and decide that the best way to solve this mystery is through some <a href= "facebook.html"> facebook </a> stalking.  </p> Then, I can figure out <a href= "money.html"> if I have enough cash </a> to find a way home.
