	mainParagraph.innerHTML = "Tommy DeVito is an American musician and singer, best known as a founding member, baritone vocalist, and lead guitarist of the rock band The Four Seasons. Tommy DeVito's musical career began in the early 1950s when he formed The Variety Trio with his brother Nick DeVito and Hank Majewski. This core group performed under various names and changing lineups. The band expanded to a quartet and changed its name to The Variatones including the addition in 1954 of singer Francis Castelluccio (later known as Frankie Valli). When they were signed to a recording contract with RCA Victor, in 1956, the quartet of DeVito/DeVito/Hank Majewski/Valli had renamed themselves The Four Lovers. Tommy and Frankie remained the only consistent members of the Four Lovers, as the group released seven singles and one album under the Four Lovers name. Their 1956 debut single, Otis Blackwell's You're the Apple of My Eye, achieved enough national sales to appear as a minor hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The single landed Tommy his first national television appearance, when the Four Lovers appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956. THought initially the founder and leader of the band, DeVito's influence diminished as Valli and Gaudio took more control of the band. He left the group in April 1970 and Valli, as well as Gaudio, agreed to assume his debt he had racked up for years while he was in the group. DeVito joined Valli and Gaudio on stage at the 2005 Broadway opening of the musical Jersey Boys, which had ended up winning a Tony for chronically the story of the group's early days.

He is only member of The Four Seasons who is not alive today; he died from cancer on December 24th, 2000. Massi had played in a few other bands before he joined The Four Lovers in 1958, with Frankie Valli and Tommy DeVito. When the group became The Four Seasons, Massi was responsible for the group's vocal arrangments. In the musical, Jersey Boys, it is stated that the reason why Massi leaves so early is because he just wanted to; no big fancy reason besides that he wanted to go home. Although Massi may not be the most well known out of all the members of THe Four Seasons, he is still one of the pillars that made this group so iconic and great.";

He became renowned for his voice as the lead vocalist of The Four Seasons, a group that became a major hit during the 1960's. Some of their biggest hits included: Sherry, Walk Like a Man, and Working My Way Back to You. When Frankie Valli took on a solo career and became well know for certain singles, especially Can't Take My Eyes Off of You. You may be thinking, If this guy was big in the 60's, why does a twenty-something college student like him? Well, I'm glad you asked. In middle school, my Nana introduced my to the music of The Four Seasons through a new musical coming out called Jersey Boys. It was a musical about how The Four Seasons came together, who each of the four members are, and how the stories of their lives intertwined and connected with each other as they became one of the most famous groups in music history. The picture below shows the Broadway stars of Jersey Boys with the one and only Frankie Valli himself. (Credit for majority of information this paragraph goes to Wikipedia)";
