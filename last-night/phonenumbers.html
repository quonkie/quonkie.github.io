	<p> I start to search through all my contacts because the <a href= "note.html"> note </a> Nick left me is just bizarre. I don't even think I know who he is...do I? Unfortunately, I find that Nick is a very common name in my phone. So common, that I have 5 different contacts for "Nick". Cuss, whose place am I at? Maybe he has a photo of him somewhere around here. I'm better with <a href= "facebook.html"> faces </a> than names anyways. Besides, while I'm here I might as well take advantage of a free cup of <a href= "coffee.html"> coffee </a> and food before I figure out how to <a href= "money.html"> leave. </a>  </p>
