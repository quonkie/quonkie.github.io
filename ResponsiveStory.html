<p id="first">
	First, you are excited about this project.
</p>

<p id="second">
	You make sure you are hydrated and are ready to get working.
</p>

<p id="third">
	Now you're in the zone, fully focused...
</p>

<p id="fourth">
	until you get frustrated when your code is not working.
</p>

<p id="fifth">
	So, you decide water is not enough to get through this...
</p>

<p id="sixth">
	and you get a cup of tea. 
</p>

<p id="seventh">
	Alright, back on track! 
</p>

<p id="eighth">
	Until you get distracted... 
</p>

<p id="ninth">
	Time to put the phone away.
</p>

<p id="tenth">
	Treat yourself to some chocolate instead while working.
</p>

<p id="eleventh">
	And you keep trudging along...
</p>

<p id="twelveth">
	Until NOTHING works. 
</p>

<p id="thirteenth">
	Time to give up and cry.  
</p>

<p id="fourteenth">
	Maybe a glass of wine will help you relax...  
</p>

<p id="fifteenth">
	...or the whole bottle  
</p>

<p id="sixteenth">
	But it still doesn't help you fix your code.   
</p>

<p id="seventeenth">
	And now you are just FED UP...  
</p>

<p id="eighteenth">
	...and you want to throw your computer out the door. 
</p>

<p id="nineteenth">
	Right before you throw it, something stops you at the last minute... 
</p>

<p id="twentieth">
	"Don't do it! Don't throw it! Let's work on it together" says your work buddy. 
</p>

<p id="twenty-one">
	"Oh." You realize that help is a good idea, "Thanks buddy."   
</p>

<p id="twenty-two">
	Hug it out.    
</p>

<p id="twenty-three">
	Let's finish this project together.    
</p>

<p id="twenty-four">
	You give it all you got and hope it pays off...    
</p>

<p id="twenty-five">
	...but eventually, you are done for the night.   
</p>

<h1 id="twenty-six">
	The End.  
</h1>
