I send a message out to a couple of my friends that were in the group chat to see if anyone is around to give me a ride. I wait for 15 minutes to see if anyone will answer, but my phone doesn't buzz. Exasperated, I decide to throw on my shoes and figure out another way to get home. As I reach for my shoes, I hear the front door begin to unlock. I turned around and see Nick walking in through the door. We say hi and chat for a bit about what happened last night. He offers to give me a ride home because he told Janet and his parents that he would drive down to meet them for lunch anyway. So we get in his car and continue to talk as we head out of the city. A night out in Denver was great, but I am so glad to be heading home.
