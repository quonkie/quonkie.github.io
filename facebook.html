<h1> I wonder if Facebook can help me figure out who this guy is </h1>

<p> I know I shouldn't assume this, but at this point almost everyone has a Facebook account. He's gotta have one. I search "Nick Denver Colorado" and see what I find. The search bar brings up a couple of options, but as I look down the list I see that this Nick is friends with my friend Janet. I click on his name and am taken to his profile. There is not much on his profile that is public, but I do find a picture of him and Janet next to her parents and their dog. Then, it hits me. <i> Nick, </i> as in Janet's older brother Nick. I remember she told me she had an older brother, I just forgot that he lived here in Denver. I also have never met him (well, I don't remember meeting him last night) so that makes sense why I was so confused. I sigh with relief. Well, that's one mystery solved. Now to just find a way <a href= "money.html"> out of here. </a> </p>
