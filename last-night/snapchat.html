<h1> Luckily, Janet had posted a lot on her Snapchat <h1>

<p> I scrolled down to find that she had documented our adventure through multiple snaps taken throughout the night. The last few snaps showed her taking a video selfie of herself with Nick with the caption "When your bro hooks you and your bestie up with a place to crash at his place" and the next one showing her taking another selfie hugging her Nick captioned "Love my bro" and I can see me lying on the couch in the background asleep. Now her <a href= "text-messages.html"> text </a> finally makes sense. At least he took the time to hand write a <a href= "note.html"> note </a> before he left for work. I didn't even hear my phone buzz when Janet sent me a message. Alright, time to get <a href= "leave.html"> out of here. </a>
