<p> Hello, my name is Stephanie. I’m from Orange County, Southern California and have lived in Boulder, Colorado for 5 years. I’m a double major in Psychology and Communication with a certificate in TAM. I love Bhakti Chai, dark chocolate, red wine, sunflowers, and swing dancing. My short term life goal is to own the stuffed animal giraffe that’s sitting in the window of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory on Pearl Street (but seriously, dibs. The giraffe is going to be mine...somehow). My long term life goal is to swim the Great Barrier Reef before it goes away forever. I don’t know what I want to do after I graduate. But I’m open to suggestions. Or job offerings. </p>
